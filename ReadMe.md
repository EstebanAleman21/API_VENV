`venv` refers to a Python module that provides support for creating lightweight "virtual environments" with their own site directories, optionally isolated from system site directories. Each virtual environment has its own Python binary and can have its own independent set of installed Python packages in its site directories.

### Key Features of `venv`:
- **Isolation**: By creating a virtual environment, you can manage separate dependencies for different projects. This means you can have different versions of libraries for each project without them conflicting with each other.
- **No System Permissions Needed**: Virtual environments can be created without administrative or superuser permissions, which is useful in environments where you do not have such privileges.
- **Simplicity**: Managing dependencies with `venv` is straightforward. You can activate or deactivate environments with simple commands and manage packages within them using `pip`.

### How `venv` is Typically Used:
1. **Create a Virtual Environment**: You can create a virtual environment using the command `python -m venv <env_name>`, where `<env_name>` is the name you want to give to your virtual environment.

2. **Activating the Virtual Environment**:
   - On Windows, activate it with:
     ```bash
     <env_name>\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS and Linux, activate it with:
     ```bash
     source <env_name>/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Using the Virtual Environment**:
   - While the environment is active, any Python or pip commands you use will operate within the virtual environment rather than the global Python installation.
   - This is useful for installing, updating, and removing Python packages within the environment.

4. **Deactivating the Virtual Environment**:
   - When you're done working in the virtual environment, you can deactivate it by simply typing:
     ```bash
     deactivate
     ```
   - This returns your terminal to the normal system environment.

### Common Use Cases:
- **Development of Python Projects**: `venv` is especially useful in development settings where multiple Python projects are being worked on simultaneously, each possibly requiring different versions of libraries.
- **Experimentation**: When testing new libraries or versions, a virtual environment is ideal to avoid affecting other development work.
- **Production Deployments**: In production, virtual environments can help ensure that your application runs with the exact versions of libraries that it was developed and tested with.

By using `venv`, developers can manage project-specific dependencies more easily, avoiding conflicts between packages and ensuring that projects are portable and reproducible.
